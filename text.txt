Wazuh is an open-source security detection, visibility, and compliance platform. It uses a combination of different components, including decoders and rules, to monitor and analyze security events.

Decoders in Wazuh are responsible for taking raw event data from various sources, such as logs and network packets, and converting them into a standard format that can be processed by the Wazuh engine. The Wazuh decoder library includes decoders for a wide range of log formats and network protocols. Decoders allow Wazuh to normalize events across different systems, making it easier to compare and analyze security events across an organization.

Wazuh rules are used to detect security threats or anomalies based on the normalized event data generated by the decoders. The rules can be customized based on the specific security requirements of an organization. Wazuh provides a rule management system that allows users to configure, enable, and disable rules based on their requirements.

Wazuh rules are written in the YAML format, and they include information such as the type of event to look for, the conditions that trigger the event, and the actions to take when the event is detected. Some common actions that can be taken when a rule is triggered include generating alerts, blocking traffic, or executing custom scripts.

Together, the decoders and rules in Wazuh allow organizations to monitor their systems and detect security threats in real-time. By normalizing and analyzing event data from multiple sources, Wazuh can provide a comprehensive view of an organization's security posture and help identify potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited.
